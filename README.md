# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction-
An end-to-end-Regression Machine Learning Project
The end goal of the project is to build a real estate price prediction website. 
We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression,Tree based models,ensemble models using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com.
Then would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. 
Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price
